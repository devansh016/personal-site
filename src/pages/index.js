          <p>Hi! Iâ€™m Devansh. Welcome to my little home on the web.</p>
          <p>I'm part of the web developing team at ACM JUIT.</p>
          <p>I am a young and energetic professional, looking for challenging opportunities to grow my skills.</p>
          <p>My intellectual curiosity also drives me to be a lifelong learner, and so I'm seeking to connect with like-minded people to learn and grow more. And in the way won't mind working under someone to know how everything works</p>
          <p>I love building things, and have worked across the engineering and product design stack. You can reach me at hello@devanshchaudhary.me</p>
